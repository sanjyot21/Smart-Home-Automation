# Smart-Home-Automation
Home Automation using  Arduino UNO Board and some sensors...

The most common applications of home automation are lighting control, door opening, kitchen appliances, and many more.
It close and open the gate whenever the person is detected nearby.
It buzzers the alarm when gas is detected in home which is the safety application of our smart home automation.
Our project is also design to save energy as a person can say to switch on or off the light whenever he wants so that he/she donâ€™t have to stand up from his/her place to do the action. Same with Air Conditioner. 
Our project is made for hand free technology as we have a voice controller in our application.
