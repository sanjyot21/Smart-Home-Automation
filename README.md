# Smart-Home-Automation
Home Automation using  Arduino UNO Board and some sensors...

The most common applications of home automation are lighting control, door opening, kitchen appliances, and many more.
It close and open the gate whenever the person is detected nearby.
It buzzers the alarm when gas is detected in home which is the safety application of our smart home automation.
Our project is also design to save energy as a person can say to switch on or off the light whenever he wants so that he/she donâ€™t have to stand up from his/her place to do the action. Same with Air Conditioner. 
Our project is made for hand free technology as we have a voice controller in our application.

## Requirements
* Requirements
* Arduino Uno board
* Breadboard and jumper wires
* Sensors and modules (e.g. temperature and humidity sensor, motion sensor, relay module)
* Arduino IDE (or other software for programming the board)
* Mobile app (optional)

For Connecting the Bluetooth Module with Mobile Application, download the App from Google PlayStore:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.himanshu.ArduinoAutomation 

## Usage
* Connect the sensors and modules to the Arduino Uno board, following the wiring diagram provided in the code comments
* Configure the rules and preferences for your home automation system in the code (e.g. turn on the lights when motion is detected)
* Power on the board and observe the system in action
* Optionally, download and install a mobile app to control the system remotely
